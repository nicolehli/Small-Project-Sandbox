###### Practices:
- [x] float our sidebar red block to the left
- [x] float multiple elements in same direction will stack horizontally
- [x] float and hiding overflow (1. clearing with child element / clear: both and 2. clearing with parent element / overflow: hidden)

###### Notes:
* floats applies to only block boxes. Inline boxes are aligned wtih text-align properties.
* “Clearing” a float is when we tell a block to ignore any floats that appear before it.
